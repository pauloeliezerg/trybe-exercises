# Section - Redux: The global state of the application

This block belongs to the Front-end module of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s course. The content focused on how to use the Redux feature, which can be combined with React or used for state control in pure JavaScript and TypeScript. In addition to the control of the Global State promoted by Redux (which helps in the transmission of information between components, avoiding Prop Drilling), it was also studied how to use this feature in conjunction with asynchronicity and also how to test applications with all the features learned so far.
