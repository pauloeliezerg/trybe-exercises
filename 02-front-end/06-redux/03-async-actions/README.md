# DAY 03

On this day, we saw how to use asynchronous functions in Redux + React through thunk, which acts as a middleware that allows functions to be passed to the Dispatcher, thus ensuring the possibility of updating the global state asynchronously, which allows, for example, the storage of the return of Promises (such as a fetch for an API) in the global state.
