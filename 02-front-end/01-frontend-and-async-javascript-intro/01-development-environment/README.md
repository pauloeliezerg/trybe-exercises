# DAY 01

On this day, the initial front-end concepts were introduced from the initialization of a project using npm to manage node packages, Vite as a bundler (which helps the browser to bridge the gap with the libraries installed in the node modules) ESLint as a linter tool, which helps maintain code cleanliness, importing library packages and, finally, deploying the project using free tools like Surge.
