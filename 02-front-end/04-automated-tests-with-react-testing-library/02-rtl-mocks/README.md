# DAY 02

On this day, the concepts of mocking and its application in integration tests of applications with React were introduced, using the vi bundler and its interaction libraries with Jest. From this, it was possible to mock functions intrinsic to the application, change their definitions during the execution of the tests, change their value as many times as necessary, clean the mocks, mock the return of asynchronous functions, Promises, APIs and the global fetch function, and it was also seen how to do this using only Jest as an alternative.
