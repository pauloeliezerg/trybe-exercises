# DAY 01

On this day, the concepts of RTL (React Testing Library) were introduced to perform integration tests, combining rendering tests of the application and its components with the functionality of each element present. To this end, a step-by-step demonstration of how to configure the development environment and how to use RTL in conjunction with the Vite bundler (Vitest) was given. Functions that render components and simulate user actions (userEvent) were presented.
