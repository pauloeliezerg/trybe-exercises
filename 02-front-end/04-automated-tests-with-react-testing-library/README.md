# Section - Automated tests with React Test Library

This block belongs to the Front-end module of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s course. The content of the block focused on testing using the React framework and its testing library, the React Testing Library (RTL). We saw its installation, mocking functions in different ways, how to manipulate these mocks according to the need and also how to perform tests in an application encapsulated by React Router.
