# Section - Styling and Agile Practices

This block belongs to the Front-end module of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s course. The content focused on talking about Agile principles (especially Scrum and Kanban) and how to style components without scope leakage, through CSS Modules and Styled Components (React library). The difference in efficiency between waterfall and sprint development was explained, the 4 Agile fundamentals were explained, the dynamics of meetings and the Kanban task organization system were described. Regarding CSS, the difference between using Pure CSS and the CSS Modules and Styled Components methods was demonstrated, in the case of the latter, how to manipulate styles, create a Global Style and a ThemeProvider so that the entire application can use styles that can be repeated in the code.
