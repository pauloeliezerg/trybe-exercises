# DAY 02

On this day, the concept of Styled Components was introduced, a library focused on styling web applications, with the feature of not leaking scope, allowing the creation of a global style, issuing props between components and storing a ThemeProvider that can be accessed at any level of the application. It is a powerful library for making style code cohesive, simple and compact.
