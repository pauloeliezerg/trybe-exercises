# Section - Deeper dive into React

This block belongs to the Front-end module of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s course. The content of this block addressed two very powerful tools in terms of control and performance of an application: React Router, which helps the client navigate through the application, and useEffect, which has power over the cycle of a component and the scope to be executed through each user action. Both tools make the application much richer and more functional in essence.
