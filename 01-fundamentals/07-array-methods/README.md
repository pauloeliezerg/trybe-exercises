# Section - Array methods

This block belongs to the fundamentals module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course. The block content deals with the definition of High Order Functions (HOFs), Array Methods (.map(), .filter(), .sort(), .find(), .forEach(), .reduce()) and array and object manipulation tools, such as destructuring, spread operator and default parameters, which allows great versatility when manipulating the code and also better readability and conciseness for it.
