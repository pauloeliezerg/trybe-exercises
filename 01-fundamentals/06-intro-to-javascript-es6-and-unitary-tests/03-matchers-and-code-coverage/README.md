# DAY 03

On this day, new matchers were presented, such as .not(), and matchers for arrays, objects and exceptions (.toThrow()) and the concept of test coverage was also introduced, which allows you to visualize (including interactively via HTML) how much of the code is covered by tests by executing a command in the terminal.
