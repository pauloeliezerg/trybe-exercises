# Section - HTML AND CSS

This block belongs to the fundamentals module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course. The block content's about the main HTML tags to create the structure of Web Pages, how to use CSS to style these tags, using different ways to select HTML elements, and how to change the positioning of elements on the page and how some specific properties change the dimensions of the elements, also the meaning that each HTML element carries and how this impacts the interpretation of the page content by robots and other Internet elements, contributing to the page accessibility.

With this in mind, here you will find the exercises developed to consolidate the knowledge acquired throughout this section in this [project](placeholder).
