# Section - Unix, Shell and Git

This block belongs to the Fundamentals module of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s course. In this block I learned about Unix, its structure (Kernel, Shell and applications) and its file system, commands related to creating and manipulating files, the Git versioning tool and its commands, creating the first repository in GitHub, organizing branches, pull requests and the differences between local and remote repositories.

With this in mind, here you will find the exercises I developed to consolidate the knowledge I acquired throughout this section in this [portfolio](https://github.com/pauloeliezerg/trybe-exercises).
