# FUNDAMENTALS

In this module, the fundamentals of programming and Web Development were taught: the Unix operating system, the Shell interface, the Git versioning tool, the bases of HTML and CSS, ES6 JavaScript and the DOM, forms and Flexbox events, pava CSS and JavaScript frameworks , testing with Jest and delving deeper into some Array Methods.

With this, it is possible to create the basis of web pages, styling them, making them responsive and dynamic and carrying out operations based on the data sent through them.

With that in mind, this folder contains all the learning activities I developed throughout the Fundamentals module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course.
